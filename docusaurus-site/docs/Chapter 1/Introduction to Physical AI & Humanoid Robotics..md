# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to intelligent systems that interact with the real world through a physical body. Unlike purely digital AI, which operates solely in virtual environments (e.g., software agents, chatbots), Physical AI perceives, acts, and learns within a physical space. This involves sensing the environment, making decisions based on those perceptions, and executing actions that directly affect the physical world.

## Understanding Embodied Intelligence

**Embodied Intelligence** is a key concept within Physical AI, emphasizing that an agent's intelligence is deeply tied to its physical form and its interactions with the environment. It suggests that cognitive processes are not solely abstract computations but are shaped by the body's structure, sensory capabilities, and motor skills. For example, a robot's ability to grasp an object is influenced by the design of its grippers, the tactile sensors it possesses, and its physical manipulation capabilities. This contrasts with disembodied AI, where the physical form is largely irrelevant to intelligence.
