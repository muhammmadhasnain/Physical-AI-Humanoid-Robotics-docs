# Glossary

## Terms

- **Physical AI**: The concept of AI interacting with the physical world.
- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems with a physical body that can perceive and act in an environment.
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Robots designed to resemble the human body and interact in human-centered environments.
- **Sensors**: Devices that detect and respond to events or changes in the physical environment.
  - **LiDAR**: (Light Detection and Ranging) A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. In robotics, used for mapping and navigation.
  - **Depth Cameras**: Cameras that provide depth information, typically used for object recognition and perception in 3D environments.
  - **IMUs**: (Inertial Measurement Units) Electronic devices that measure and report a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Used for orientation and balance in robotics.
  - **Force/Torque sensors**: Sensors used to measure forces and moments (torques) applied to a robot's end-effector or joints, providing feedback for manipulation.
- **Software Ecosystem**: The collection of software tools and frameworks used for robotics and AI development.
- **ROS 2**: (Robot Operating System 2) A flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.
- **Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robotics simulator. It accurately and efficiently simulates populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: A platform for robotics development, including tools for simulation, perception, and AI.
- **Unity**: A cross-platform game engine often used for robotics simulation and visualization due to its advanced graphics and physics capabilities.
- **Capstone Project**: The final autonomous humanoid robot project for the course.
- **Python**: A high-level, interpreted programming language widely used in AI, machine learning, and robotics.
- **Docusaurus**: A static site generator for building documentation websites.
