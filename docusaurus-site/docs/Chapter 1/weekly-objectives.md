# Weekly Learning Objectives

## Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

### Week 1 Objectives

-   **Define Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence**: Students will be able to articulate what Physical AI is and explain the concept of embodied intelligence, differentiating it from purely digital AI systems.
-   **Understand Humanoid Robotics Basics**: Students will gain an introductory understanding of humanoid robots, their importance, and their applications in human-centered environments.
-   **Overview of Key Sensor Systems**: Students will be introduced to the primary sensor types used in humanoid robotics, including LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs, and Force/Torque sensors, understanding their basic functions.

### Week 2 Objectives

-   **Explore Embodied Intelligence Applications**: Students will identify and describe various real-world examples and case studies where embodied intelligence is applied.
-   **Analyze Humanoid Robot Structure**: Students will be able to recognize and understand the basic structural components and typical sensor placements on humanoid robots, possibly referencing diagrams.
-   **Connect Sensors to Robotics Functions**: Students will relate specific sensor types (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs, Force/Torque) to their roles in perception, navigation, manipulation, and interaction within humanoid robotics.
-   **Introduction to Course Tools and Capstone**: Students will get an overview of the main software and hardware tools (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity) used in the course and understand the high-level goals of the capstone project (Autonomous Humanoid capable of VLA).
