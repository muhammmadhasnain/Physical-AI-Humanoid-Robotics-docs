# Chapter 2: Robotic Nervous System & Simulation

This chapter explains how robots "think and feel" internally through ROS 2, and how we simulate robots using Gazebo and Unity to build a full Digital Twin. The content will prepare students to:

- Understand robot control pipelines
- Build ROS 2 nodes & controllers
- Simulate full humanoid robots
- Connect Python agents with ROS 2
- Visualize robots realistically in Unity
