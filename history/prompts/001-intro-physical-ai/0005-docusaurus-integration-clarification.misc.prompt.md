## Prompt

I want to implement this feature in Docusaurus.

## Response snapshot

I understand you want to integrate the "Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" content into Docusaurus. The current specification for "Chapter 1" does not include details about Docusaurus integration. This is a new requirement that would typically be addressed either by updating the existing feature's plan or by creating a new feature specifically for the Docusaurus integration. Since the `/sp.clarify` command is meant for refining an *existing* specification and we previously determined there were no critical ambiguities in the "Chapter 1" spec, I'm going to complete this `sp.clarify` command as having found no ambiguities. After this, I will recommend the next steps to incorporate the Docusaurus integration.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User clarified intent for Docusaurus integration, identified as a new requirement beyond current spec.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files directly modified by this clarification.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Suggest creating new feature or updating plan for Docusaurus integration.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user's intent to integrate with Docusaurus was clarified. This is a new requirement that needs to be addressed either by updating the current feature's plan or by creating a new feature specification. The current /sp.clarify command is completed as no ambiguities were found in the existing spec, but new requirements were identified.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
