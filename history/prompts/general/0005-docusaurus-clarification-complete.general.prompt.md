prompt_text: "I want to switch to the 001-feature-name branch.\n<command-message>sp.clarify is running…</command-message>\n<command-name>/sp.clarify</command-name>## User Input\n\n```text\n$ARGUMENTS\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nGoal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.\n\nNote: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/sp.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/sp.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/sp.plan` or run `/sp.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/sp.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS\n\n---\n\nAs the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.\n\n1) Determine Stage\n   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general\n\n2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:\n   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)\n   - Route is automatically determined by stage:\n     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`\n     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)\n     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`\n\n3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)\n   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`\n   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.\n   - If the script fails:\n     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)\n     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file\n     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT\n\n4) Validate + report\n   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.\n   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`."\nresponse_text: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\n\n**Coverage Summary:**\n\n*   Functional Scope & Behavior: Clear\n*   Domain & Data Model: Clear\n*   Interaction & UX Flow: Clear\n*   Non-Functional Quality Attributes: Clear\n*   Integration & External Dependencies: Clear\n*   Edge Cases & Failure Handling: Clear (sufficient for spec level)\n*   Constraints & Tradeoffs: Clear\n*   Terminology & Consistency: Clear\n*   Completion Signals: Clear\n*   Misc / Placeholders: Clear\n\nThe specification `specs/001-docusaurus-setup/spec.md` is complete and ready to proceed to the planning phase.\n\n**Suggested next command**: `/sp.plan`"
outcome: success
evaluation: Clarification skipped as no ambiguities found.
